Retail Sales & Inventory Intelligence System using Python||SQL||Power BI

This repository contains the complete data analysis project for a retail company, built using Python (Pandas) and Power BI. The project analyzes 9 different datasets to provide insights into sales, inventory, staff performance, and customer behavior.

Key Insights
Total Revenue: The company generated $7.69 million in total sales.

Top Performers: The Baldwin Bikes (NY) store is the top-performing location, and Mountain Bikes is the most profitable category.

Critical Sales Trend: The business saw strong sales in 2016-2017, followed by a severe drop in sales volume starting in early 2018.

Operational Failure: 31.7% of all shipped orders were delayed, arriving after the customer's required date.

Inventory Crisis: 25 product lines are completely out-of-stock, and 141 are at critical low-stock levels, representing significant lost revenue.

Tech Stack
Data Cleaning: Python (Pandas)

Data Analysis: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)

Data Visualization: Power BI

Project Structure
/ (Root): Contains the 9 raw data CSV files (e.g., orders.csv, customers.csv, etc.).

clean_data.py: Python script to load all 9 raw files, clean them, and save them as cleaned_*.csv files.

analysis.py: Python script to load the cleaned files, perform all 7 business use case analyses, and save the results as analysis_*.csv files and plot_*.png images.

YourProjectName.pbix: The final, interactive Power BI dashboard file. (Replace with your actual file name)

*.png: Plot images generated by the analysis script.

Final Report Summary
1. Executive Summary
This report outlines a data analysis solution for a retail company. The primary goal was to analyze operations—from sales to inventory—to extract actionable insights. By processing 9 datasets, we successfully built a system that identifies key performance indicators, uncovers operational inefficiencies, and provides a clear view of the company's health.

2. Project Approach
Phase 1: Data Preprocessing (Python & Pandas): Cleaned and transformed 9 raw CSVs. Handled null values, formatted dates, and engineered a total_price feature.

Phase 2: Data Analysis (Python & Pandas): Answered all 7 core business questions, such as top-selling brands, staff performance, and inventory levels.

Phase 3: Visualization (Power BI): Loaded the 9 cleaned CSVs into Power BI. Built a relational data model and created a multi-page interactive dashboard to consolidate all findings.

3. Recommendations
Investigate the 2018 Sales Drop (Immediate Priority): This is an existential threat that must be understood.

Address Shipping Delays: Conduct a root-cause analysis of the 31.7% delay rate to fix the fulfillment process.

Triage Inventory: Immediately re-order the 25 out-of-stock items and 141 low-stock items to recapture lost revenue.

Adopt the Dashboard: Use the Power BI dashboard for weekly check-ins to monitor sales, track orders, and manage inventory proactively.
